### Omnipotent Six
Omnipotent Six is a single-player game inspired by the classic game of Snakes & Ladders, where the goal of having
your player piece go to space number 100 on the board remains the same. Instead of having snakes and ladders, you will
either move up or down one to five spaces the game board whenever your player piece lands on a digit that is a multiple
of 6, hence the "Six" in Omnipotent Six. In other words, the multiples of 6 are omnipotent because they know your fate
in this game! 

### How to play
To play Omnipotent Six, simply click on the buttons in the Application screen to start and move your player piece.

### Setup recommendations

Using IntelliJ IDE to run this game is strongly recommended.
